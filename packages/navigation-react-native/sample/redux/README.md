# Navigation Native Redux
Navigation doesn't own your components so it integrates well with other libraries, like Redux.

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the Redux example:

    npm install
    cd ios && pod install && cd ..
    react-native start
    react-native run-android
    react-native run-ios
